<p>Sometimes spelled “metaoidioplasty;” sometimes shortened to “meta.” The surgical process of “freeing up” the enlarged clitoris from its connective tissue (the clitoris is typically elongated and changed somewhat in appearance from testosterone therapy) so that it is presented on the body in a more phallic or penis-like manner. Scrotal implants may or may not be added. See also “genital reconstruction surgery.”</p>
