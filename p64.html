<h2>hysterectomy</h2>
<p>Sometimes shortened to “hysto.” The surgical removal of the uterus. This surgery is often pursued by FTMs as part of the transition process, as well as for health reasons. A hysterectomy is required by some states in order to legally change one’s gender status from female to male. See also “oophorectomy.”</p>
