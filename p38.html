<h2>sex reassignment surgery (SRS)
</h2>
<p>Commonly termed a “sex change operation.” This term is somewhat of a misnomer (especially for FTMs), because it implies there is one surgical procedure for successful transition.</p>
<br/>
<p>For MTFs, SRS usually indicates vaginoplasty and/or orchiectomy. Breast augmentation/implants may or may not be needed or desired by MTFs. For FTMs, there are several surgical procedures involved with gender transition, including chest reconstruction surgery, hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and different types of genital reconstruction surgery (GRS).</p>
<br/>
<p>Many FTMs undergo chest surgery, but not GRS. Some have chest surgery and a hysterectomy, but not GRS. Some have all three procedures (which may total more than three surgeries, as GRS can often involve several surgical procedures).</p>
<br/>
<p>Both MTFs and FTMs may not be able to afford any surgery at all, yet live very successfully as women men in society through ongoing hormone treatment.</p>
<br/>
<p>The requirements for “changing sex” under the law (i.e., changing one’s legally recognized sex) vary from state to state, and often depend on the amount and type of surgery or hormone therapy one has had. A few states will not allow for a change in legal sex no matter how much surgery of treatment one has had. Thus, the idea that there is one, clear-cut surgical solution for “changing sex” is a bit misleading. See also “chest surgery,” “genital reconstruction surgery (GRS),” “hysterectomy,” “oophorectomy,” “orchiectomy,” and “vaginoplasty.”</P>
