<h2>peri-areolar</h2>
<p>Sometimes shortened to “peri.” A type of FTM chest surgery procedure that is effective for individuals with small to medium amounts of breast tissue. In the periareolar method, an incision is made along the entire circumference of the areola. The nipple is usually left attached to the body via a pedicle in order to maintain sensation. Breast tissue is then “scooped out” by scalpel, or with a combination of scalpel and liposuction. The areola may be trimmed somewhat to reduce its size. Excess skin on the chest may also be trimmed away along the circumference of the incision. The skin is then pulled taut toward the center of the opening and the nipple is reattached to cover the opening—much like pulling a drawstring bag closed. Thus, this procedure is also sometimes referred to as the drawstring or “purse string” technique. The nipple/areola may be repositioned slightly, depending on original chest size and the available skin. See also “chest surgery.”</p>
