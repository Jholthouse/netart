<p>"When I came out my parents made me go talk to their church bishop. I was told I'm broken, that they were taking me to counseling to help fix me, and that if things got worse they would have to take more drastic actions. They told me it's just a phase and that I could be "fixed." They also forbid me from telling anyone. To this day they cannot accept that I'm gay. When I told my friends, everything seemed fine and dandy at first, then I found out a bunch of them were talking about me behind my back and they asked me to keep my sexuality to myself because it would be easier for them. It was horrible."</p>
