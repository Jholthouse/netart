<h2>estrogen or estradiol</h2>
<p>Sometimes shortened to “E.” A hormone responsible for producing feminine secondary sex characteristics such as breast growth and increased fat distribution around the hips and waist. Estrogen therapy is administered to MTFs to induce the presence of feminine secondary sex characteristics. It may also cause softening of the skin, slowing or stopping of scalp hair loss, decrease in muscle mass, decrease in sex drive, decreased erections, and decrease in testicular size. Estrogen can be taken in pill, patch, or injection forms.</p>
