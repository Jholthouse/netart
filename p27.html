<p>"In between the multiple ignorant and rejecting things my mom told me, like, "Imagine all the things people will say," she said something about this not being Europe and that if I wanted that kind of lifestyle I should just move to a more gay country. And she said, and I am not even kidding, "It's like your dad cheating on me. We are not going to scream it to the world. You can live a happy life in secret." I now know that if I come out to the world (and by world I mean my family and close friends) my mom will not offer any support AND that my dad is cheating on my mom. One can learn so much things in one day."</p>
