<h2>vaginoplasty</h2>
<p>The surgical creation of a vagina. In MTF vaginoplasty, the skin of foreskin and penis is typically inverted to form a fully sensate vagina. A clitoris supplied with nerve endings can be formed from part of the glans of the penis. In cases of shortage of skin, or when a vaginoplasty has failed, a vaginal lining can be created from skin grafts from the thighs or hips, or a section of colon may be used. These linings may not provide the same sensate qualities as results from the penile inversion method, but the vaginal opening is identical.</p>
