<h2>passing</h2>
<p>Successfully being perceived as a member of your preferred gender regardless of actual birth sex. Some transsexual people object to the term “passing,” as it implies that one is being mistaken for something they are not. A preferable phrasing is “being read as a man” or ‘being read as a woman.”</p>
