<h2>packing</h2>
<p>The process of creating a male-looking bulge in one’s crotch. This can be accomplished through a home-made or store-bought pants stuffer, or through a realisticlooking prosthetic device. A packing device may be referred to as a “packer” or “packy,” or as an “STP packer” if it can also be used to pee through while standing up (STP= Stand To Pee). Some guys simply refer to their packer or prosthetic as a cock and balls, a dick, etc.</p>
<br/>
<p>Some FTMs do not pack at all– some find it too hot and/or sticky, others find it uncomfortable and/or inconvenient, and still others find it personally unnecessary. Some FTMs pack simply for the sake of creating a realistic-looking bulge in their pants. Others may pack only on certain occasions (while swimming, while in the locker room, or wearing tight-fitting pants). Still others may feel incomplete and/or conspicuous without wearing a packer or prosthetic device. Some have realistic prosthetics that are affixed to the skin for wear throughout the day and night. For some FTMs, the term “packing” itself is not even an accurate descriptor for the wearing of a prosthetic device– a prosthetic may be considered more an extension of the body rather than merely a pants-stuffer</p>
