<h2>Written by, Nick Sherman</h2>
<p>"I came out as trans* right before high school, and I was also kind of a hot mess, and pretty well known as a freak. People didn't really know what I was and instead of asking, people just made things up or thought of me as weird/gross/to be avoided, and certainly not someone you would date.</p>
<br/>
<p>"Junior year I got really fed up with it all, and since I liked a guy, I asked him out for a change. We were dating for a couple weeks before the question of gender came up, and then I realized â€“ he hadn't been sure of my gender or sex the whole time, but was dating me anyway, liking me as a person. Explaining my identity to him was the easiest and least threatening time I've ever come out, and today he and I have been married for over a year."</p>
